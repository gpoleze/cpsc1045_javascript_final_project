<h1>Learning Numbers Game</h1>
<p>The goal of this project was to create a game for kids, with ages near 5, for learning numbers from 1 to 50.</p>
<p>Since kids with that age usualy do not know how to read, it was inserted a text to speech function.</p>
<p>The game works well on computer, but it was thought to be played on smartphones, wich explain its style presentation</p>
